# Grund 
## TLDR
You're free to use this if your brain is the size of a wall bust.
Variables are scoped and global, and the standard library is pretty bad; you are welcome.
Its syntax is python c# like. 
I will soon write documentation.
Anyway, I will release the compiled version soon if anyone actually wants to use this burning plastic.
